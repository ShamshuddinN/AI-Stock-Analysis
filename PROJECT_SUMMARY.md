2. **AI-Powered News Analyzer** (`analyzer.py`)
   - Sentiment analysis using TextBlob
   - Investment-focused keyword extraction (81+ terms)
   - Company name matching with NSE database
   - Quantitative investment scoring algorithm
   - Financial information extraction

3. **Interactive Dashboard** (`dashboard.py`)
   - Real-time web interface with Plotly/Dash
   - Multiple analysis tabs (Overview, Companies, Sentiment, Insights)
   - Filtering and visualization capabilities
   - Company-wise analysis and trends

4. **Complete Pipeline** (`main.py`)
   - End-to-end orchestration

## 🔧 System Capabilities

### **News Processing**
- ✅ Multi-source scraping (4 major financial news sources)
- ✅ RSS feed parsing and web scraping
- ✅ Duplicate detection and content enrichment
- ✅ Rate limiting and ethical scraping

### **AI Analysis**
- ✅ Sentiment analysis (TextBlob + custom keywords)
- ✅ Company matching with confidence scoring
- ✅ Investment relevance scoring (proprietary algorithm)
- ✅ Financial information extraction
- ✅ Impact categorization (Positive/Negative/Neutral)

### **Data Management**
- ✅ NSE companies database (2139 companies loaded)

## 📈 Investment Scoring Algorithm

The system uses a proprietary scoring formula:
```
Investment Score = 0.4×|Sentiment| + 0.3×Keywords + 0.2×Companies + 0.1×Source
```

- **Sentiment (40%)**: AI-powered polarity analysis
- **Keywords (30%)**: Investment-specific term density  
- **Companies (20%)**: Number and confidence of company matches
- **Source (10%)**: Credibility of news source

## 🚀 How to Use

### **Quick Start**
```bash
# 1. Run full analysis
python main.py --mode full

# 2. Launch interactive dashboard
python main.py --mode dashboard

# 3. Analyze specific companies
python main.py --mode companies --companies RELIANCE TCS HDFCBANK
```

### **Advanced Features**
- Schedule daily analysis with cron jobs
- Export results to CSV/JSON for further analysis
- Configure custom news sources and keywords
- Set up alerts for high-impact news

## 📊 Sample Output

The system generates insights like:

```
TOP INVESTMENT INSIGHTS:
1. Reliance Industries announces major renewable energy investment
   Companies: RELIANCE
   Sentiment: Positive (0.85)
   Investment Score: 0.892

2. TCS wins multi-billion dollar European banking contract
   Companies: TCS  
   Sentiment: Positive (0.72)
   Investment Score: 0.834
```
